# Webscraping Wikipedia Page 

* The scraping of the data from the webpage has been done by the <b>Beautifulsoup</b> library.
* Then I have represented the scraped information in the form of a neat Two-dimensional Table using the <b>Dataframe</b> function of the <b>Pandas</b> Library.
* The final populated table is converted into a CSV file <b>(Companies_Data.csv)</b>.
